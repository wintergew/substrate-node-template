# Polkadot Substrate Development Final Project
The following are the steps I've been taken during the making of my final project.
## 1. Building a blockchain
1. Forked the substrate-node-template repository
2. Switched to a new branch using `git switch -c my-learning-branch`
3. Built and run the node using `cargo build --release` and `./target/release/node-template --dev`.
4. Forked the frontend template to [my profile](https://github.com/wintergew/substrate-front-end-template)
5. Installed and run the frontend by `yarn install` and `yarn run`
6. Demonstrated a fund transfer on the node using the frontend template.
## 2. Simulating a substrate network
## 3. Adding trusted nodes to a network.
## 8. Smart contracts
